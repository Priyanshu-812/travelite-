## Authentication

Travelite uses [Clerk](https://clerk.dev) for user authentication, providing an easy and secure way to manage user logins, signups, and sessions. Clerk offers features such as passwordless authentication, user management, and secure session storage.

To configure Clerk:

1. Sign up for a Clerk account at [Clerk.dev](https://clerk.dev).
2. Create a new application and retrieve your **Frontend API** and **Backend API** keys.
3. Add the keys to your `.env` file:
   ```
   CLERK_FRONTEND_API=<Your Clerk Frontend API Key>
   CLERK_API_KEY=<Your Clerk Backend API Key>
   ```
4. Clerk handles the full authentication flow for user signups and logins, ensuring a secure user experience.

## UI & Design

Travelite's user interface is powered by **Acternity UI** and **shadcn**, a modern and responsive UI component library. This combination provides a clean, minimalistic design with a focus on user experience and performance.

- **Acternity UI**: A custom UI framework providing the base design principles for the app.
- **shadcn**: A component library integrated into the app for rapid UI development and seamless design consistency.
- **Framer Motion**: For dynamic animations and transitions to enhance the user experience.
- **Leaflet**: For interactive and dynamic maps displaying trip locations and recommendations.
